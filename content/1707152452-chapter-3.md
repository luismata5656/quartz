## 3.1 Measures of Center

### Mean

the simple average of the data

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i}{n}$$

$\bar{x}$ - mean
$x_i$ - data value
$\mu$ - population mean

#### Weighted Mean

if you have a data set with different weights, you can calculate the weighted mean using the following formula:
$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

#### Calculating the Mean from a Frequency Distribution

This is like a weighted mean, but the weights are the frequencies of the data values.
$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i}$$

### Median

the middle value of the data

When the number of data values is odd, the median is the middle value. When the number of data values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Odd: $$\frac{n+1}{2}$$
Even: $$\frac{n}{2}$$

The above equations find the index of the median value in the data set.

### Mode

the value that occurs most frequently in the data

When a data set has one mode, it is unimodal, when it has two modes, it is bimodal, and when it has more than two modes, it is multimodal.

It is possible for a data set to have no mode.

### Symmetry

$$ \text{mean} = \text{median} = \text{mode} \implies \text{symmetric}$$
$$ \text{mean} > \text{median} > \text{mode} \implies \text{right skewed}$$
$$ \text{mean} < \text{median} < \text{mode} \implies \text{left skewed}$$

> Which measure of center should I use?
>
> - Mean: when the data is symmetric with no outliers
> - Median: when the data is skewed or has outliers
> - Mode: when the data is categorical(nomial) or when the data is bimodal

### Midrange

The **midrange** is the average of the maximum and minimum values in the data set.
This measure is not used often because it is sensitive to outliers.

## 3.2 Measures of Variation

### Standard Deviation

the **standard deviation** measures the average distance of the data values from the mean.

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

There is also a shortcut formula for computing:
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{n(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2) - (\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}{n(n-1)}}$$

### Variance

the **variance** is the square of the standard deviation.

### Range

the **range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.

$$\text{range} = \text{max} - \text{min}$$

### The Empirical Rule

The empirical rule states that for a normal distribution:
68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean

### z Scores

A **z score** measures the number of standard deviations a data value is from the mean. it is calculated using the following formula:

$$ z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}$$

they don't have a unit of measurement, it is essentially a measure of how significant a value is according to the population.

### Percentiles

a **percentile** is the value below which a certain percentage of data falls.

$$P = \frac{\text{number of values below the data value}}{\text{total number of values}} \times 100$$

### Quartiles
ba
**Quartiles** are the values that divide the data into four equal parts.

$Q_1$ is the median of the lower half of the data, also is $P_{25}$
$Q_2$ is the median of the data, also is $P_{50}$
$Q_3$ is the median of the upper half of the data, also is $P_{75}$

#### Interquartile Range

$$ IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$
