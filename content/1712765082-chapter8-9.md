# Chapter 8-9: Hypothesis Testing

> 2024-04-10

## Chapter 8: One Sample Tests

### Step 1: Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0$, A statement about the value of a population parameter that is initially assumed to be true
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a$, A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis if the sample data provides enough evidence that the null hypothesis is false

#### Types of Hypotheses

- **One-Tailed Test**: The alternative hypothesis contains a less than or greater than symbol
  - $H_0$: $\mu = \mu_0$
  - $H_a$: $\mu < \mu_0$ or $\mu > \mu_0$
- **Two-Tailed Test**: The alternative hypothesis contains a not equal to symbol
  - $H_0$: $\mu = \mu_0$
  - $H_a$: $\mu \neq \mu_0$

### Step 2: Test Statistic and p-Value

- **Test Statistic**: A value calculated from the sample data that is used to make a decision about the null hypothesis
- **p-Value**: The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true
- **Significance Level**: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true

| $\alpha$ | Confidence Level |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| .10      | 90%              |
| .05      | 95%              |
| .01      | 99%              |

#### Calculating the Test Statistic

Testing for Population Proportion using the normal model:

$$ z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} $$

Testing for Population Mean using the normal model:

$$ z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} $$

Testing for population mean using the t-distribution(unkown $\sigma$):

$$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} $$

### Step 3: Decision / Conclusion

The conclusion is a boolean decision, either to reject $H_0$ or fail to reject $H_0$.

- **Reject $H_0$**: If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis
- **Fail to Reject $H_0$**: If the p-value is greater than the significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis

#### Type I and Type II Errors

- **Type I Error**: Rejecting a null hypothesis that is true
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject a null hypothesis that is false
