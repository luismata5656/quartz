# Newton's Law of Gravitation

$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$

This law represents the relationship between two obejcts of mass $m1$ and $m2$ and the distance between them $r$. The force of gravity is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

This can be used to show the Radius of a black hole's event horizon useing the folloowing equation:
$$ R = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$

This is known as the Schwarzschild radius.

## The Universal Gravitational Constant

$$ G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \frac{m^3}{kg \cdot s^2} $$

### Universal Gravitation

The force that mass 1 exerts on mass 2 is equal to the force that mass 2 exerts on mass 1.
The forces form a Newton's third law pair.
The gravitational force exerted by a uniform sphere on a particle outside the sphere is the same as if all the sphere's mass were concentrated at the center.

## Gravitational Potential Energy

$$ U = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r} $$

## Velocity of an Object in Orbit

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$

### Kepler's Laws

- The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the sun at one focus.
- A line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
- The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit.

$$ \frac{T^2}{a^3} = \frac{4 \pi^2}{GM} $$

## Orbital Period

$$ T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}} $$

### Orbital Velocity

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$

### Energy of an orbit

the centriperal force is equal to the gravitational force
$$ F = \frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$

substituting in $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ you get

$$E = -\frac{GMm}{2r}$$
