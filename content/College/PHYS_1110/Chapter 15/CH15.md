## Formulas

Wave velocity:
$$v = \lambda f$$
Wave number:
$$k=2\pi/\lambda$$
Angular frequency:
$$w=2\pi f = vk$$
Wave function:
$$y(x,t)=A\cos(kx-wt)$$
Transverse wave speed:
$$ v=\sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}$$
Wave power:
$$P\_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\mu F} w^2 A^2$$
Intensity:
$$I=\frac{P}{A}$$
Intensity inverse square law
$$\frac{I_1}{I_2}=\frac{r_2^2}{r_1^2}$$

## Mechanical Waves

Doing the "wave" at a sports game is a mechanical wave. the disturbance reverberates through the crowd but there is no transfer of matter.

### Types of Mechanical Waves

1. Pressure waves
   This is when a wave is created by a pressure change, like a sound wave.

2. surface waves
   This is when a wave is created by a surface disturbance, like a water wave.

### Periodic Waves

In a periodic wave each particle undergoes periodic motion. The wave repeats itself in space and time.
$\lambda$ is the wavelength, the distance between two consecutive crests.
$f$ is the frequency, the number of crests that pass a point in one second.

## Mathematical Description of a Wave

The wave function for a sinusoidal wave moving in the +x direction is:
$$y(x,t)=A\cos(kx-wt)$$
where $A$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, and $w$ is the angular frequency.

The quantity $k$, the wave number, is defined as $k=2\pi/\lambda$.

The quantity $w$, the angular frequency, is defined as $w=2\pi f = \frac{2\pi}{T}$.

## Power in a Wave

![PowerWave.png](assets/imgs/PowerWave.png)

Power is never negative, which means that the energy will never flow opposite to the direction of the wave propagation.

The Average Power in a wave is:
$$P_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\mu F} w^2 A^2$$

### Intensity

The intesity of a wave is the average power($P_{avg}) it carries per unit area.
If the waves spread out uniformly in all directions and no energy is absorbed, then the intensity obeys the inverse square law:
$$\frac{I_1}{I_2}=\frac{r_2^2}{r_1^2}$$

## Superposition of Waves

Interference is the superposition of two or more waves.

when two or more waves overlap the total displacement is the sum of the displacements of the individual waves.

## Standing Waves

f
Wahen waves travelin opposite directions overlap, they interfere to form a standing wave.

This wave doesn't move at the nodes and the antinodes oscillate with the largest amplitude.

## Normal Modes of a String

The normal modes are the standing waves of a string.

$$\lambda_n=\frac{2L}{n}$$

$$f_n=\frac{nv}{2L} = nf_1$$
