# CH16: Hearing and Sound

Pressure Amplitude:
$$P_{max}=BkA$$

Wave velocity in fluid:
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$$
Wave velocity in ideal gas:
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}$$
Wave velocity in solid rod:
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\rho}}$$
Intensity:
$$I = \frac{p_{max}^2}{2\rho v} = \frac{p_{max}^2}{2\sqrt{\rho B}}$$
Sound Intensity (defined):
$$\beta = (10\text{dB})\log(\frac{I}{I_0})$$
Doppler Effect:
$$f_l=\frac{v\pm v_l}{v\pm v_s}f_s$$

## Fourier Series

The mathematical proccess of breaking down a complex wave into its component sine waves is called Fourier analysis.

## Sound Intensity

Sound Waves transfer energy from one region of space to another

the wave intensity is the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave through a unit area perpendicular to the direction of wave motion.

the intensity of a sinusoidal sound wave is proportional to the square of the pressure ammplitude.

## The Decibel Scale

The ear is sensitive, so sensitive that the range of intensities of sound is measured using a logarithmic scale:

## Standing Sound Waves

If you put sound into a fluid in a pipe, the waves are reflected and a standing wave is made:
