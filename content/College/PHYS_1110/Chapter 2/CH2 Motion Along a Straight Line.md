## The 4 Equations of Motion:

$$ x=x_0+v_0t+\frac{1}{2}a_xt^2 $$

$$ v_x = v_{0}+a_xt $$

$$ v_x^2 = v_0^2 + 2a_x(x-x_0) $$

$$ x-x_0 = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_x)t $$

Motion can be described by **Velocity** and **Acceleration**

## Displacement, Time, and Average Velocity

$$ \triangle x = x_1 + x_2 $$

Average velocity is the velocity over time, while instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a certain point in time.

<aside> ðŸ“¢ Acceleration describes the rate of change of velocity with time.

## Motion with Constant Acceleration

As time goes on, V continues growing while a stays the same.

Free falling objects do this. If there is no air resistance, $g = 9.8 m/s^2$ which is the acceleration

## Velocity and Position by Integration

the acceleration of a car is not always constant

the motion may be integrated over many small time interval to give $v_x = v_{0x} + \int a_xdt$ and $x = x_0 + \int v_xdt$
