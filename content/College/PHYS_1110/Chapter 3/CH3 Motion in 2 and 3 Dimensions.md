## Position, Velocity and Acceleration Vectors:

$$ r=xi + yj+zk $$

$$ v = \frac{dr}{dt} $$

$$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} $$

$$ x = (v_0cos(\theta)t $$

## Projectile Motion
A projectile is any object given an initial velocity that then follows a path determined by the effects of gravity and air resistance
The motion is parabolic in nature
acceleration is a constant vector the entire time, but it is only perpendicular to velocity at the peak of the trajectory
## Motion in a Circle
**Uniform Circular Motion** is constant speed along a circular path
The acceleration is always pointed at the center / perpendicular to the velocity

$$ v = \frac{2\pi R}{T} $$

## Relative Velocity

The velocity of a moving object seen by a particular observer is called the velocity relative to that observer
A frame of reference is a coordinate system plus a time scale
