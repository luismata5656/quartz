# Laws of Motion

## Equations

### First Law: Law of Inertia

An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move at the same velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.

### Second Law: Law of Acceleration (F = MA)

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force acting upon it, and inversely proportional to its mass. This can be expressed as F = ma, where F is the force applied, m is the object's mass, and a is the resulting acceleration.

### Third Law: Law of Action and Reaction

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if an object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal and opposite force on the first object.

## Properties of a Force

A force is a push or pull
A force is an interaction between two objects or between an object and its environment

## Four Common Types of Forces

### Weight

The pull of gravity on an object, long range force

### Normal Force

when an object rests on a surface, it has a force that is perpendicular to the surface

### Tension

A pulling force exerted on an object by a rope, cord, etc.

### Friction

Like the normal force, but parallel to the surface

## Expanding on Newtonâ€™s Three Laws

### Law of Inertia

For an object to be in _Equilibrium_ it must have no forces acting upon it or have the sum of all vector forces sum 0

> An object in uniform circular motion will never have a $\sum F = 0$, but rather always pointing to the center

### Law of Acceleration (F = MA)

Newton's second law, also known as the Law of Acceleration, states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$ F = Ma $$

Where:

- $F$ represents the net force acting on the object,
- $M$ represents the mass of the object, and
- $a$ represents the resulting acceleration of the object.

This law implies that if a larger force is applied to an object, it will experience a greater acceleration. Similarly, if the mass of an object is increased, its acceleration will decrease for a given force.

It's important to note that the net force acting on an object is the vector sum of all the individual forces acting on it. Therefore, Newton's second law can be applied to each component of the net force to determine the acceleration in that specific direction.

In practical terms, Newton's second law is widely used in a variety of scientific and engineering applications. It forms the basis for many calculations involving forces, such as determining the force required to accelerate a vehicle or calculating the gravitational force acting on an object.

### Law of Action and Reaction

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if an object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal and opposite force on the first object.
