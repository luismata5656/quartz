## First law: $\sum F = 0$

Objects in equilibrium have a net force of 0

## Second law: $\sum F = ma$

objects in dynamic motion

## Force of Friction:

### Static Friction

$$f_s \le Âµ_s n$$

### Dynamic Friction

$$f_d = Âµ_d n$$

## Force in Circular Motion

$$F = ma_{rad} = m\frac{v^2}{R} = m(\frac{4pi^2R}{T})$$

## Using Newton's First Law in Equilibrium

When $\sum F = 0$ then the object is either at rest or traveling at a constant velocity, it can be assumed that $a=0$ a good strategy to approach these problems is to draw a sketch of the physical situation, draw FBD for the objects, with should result in $\sum F = 0$ if the mass is given, use $w=mg$ to find the weight

## Using Newton's Second Law: Dynamics

In dynamic problems, eg. when the $\sum F \neq 0$ the objects are not in equilibrium, hence accelerating.
When drawing the FBDs for these problems, only put the acceleration vector next to the weight, don't include the mass.

## Apparent Weight and Apparent Weightlessness

When an object with mass $m$ rides in an elevator with an $a_y \gt 0$ the object has a different apparent weight than when at rest.

if $a_y = -g$ that is when the elevator is in free fall, so then the object's apparent weight is equal to 0

## Friction

When an object rests or slides on a surface, the friction force is parallel to the surface

Friction occurs because of microscopic molecular interactions between the two surfaces.

### Kinetic Friction

This type of friction only occurs while an object slides over a surface, the kinetic friction force is $f_k = Âµ_k n$

### Static Friction

This is before an object slides, and can vary between zero and its maximum value before it begins to slide:
$$f_s \le Âµ_s n$$

## Fluid Resistance

Fluid Resistance is a force that depends on the speed of an object

## Terminal Speed

A falling abject has reached terminal velocity when the resistance equals the weight of the object, so the object is in equilibrium.

## Dynamics of Circular Motion

If a particle is in uniform circular motion, both its acceleration and the net force on it are directed toward the center of the circle
![[Phys_DynCircMotion 1.png]]$$F_{net} = ma_{rad} = \frac{mv^2}{R}$$

### Centrifugal Force

In an inertial frame of reference, there is no such thing as centrifugal force, because $\frac{mv^2}{R}$ is not a force and doesn't belong on an FBD

### Car Rounding a Banked Curve Problem

At what angle should a curve be banked so a car can make the turn even with no friction?
![[Phys_DynCircMotion_01 1.png]]

the centripetal acceleration of the car in the x-direction: $a_{rad} = v^2 / R$ and 0 for y. using Newton's second law:

$$\sum F_y = ncos\beta - mg = 0$$
$$\sum F_x = nsin\beta = ma_{rad}$$
$$(\frac{mg}{cos\beta})sin\beta = ma_{rad}$$ $$gtan\beta = a_{rad} = \frac{v^2}{R}$$
Therefore: $$\beta = tan^{-1}(\frac{a_{rad}}{g}) = tan^{-1}
(\frac{v^2}{gR})$$

## The Fundamental Forces of Nature

According to current data, there are four distinct fundamental forces:

- gravitational interactions
- electromagnetic interactions
- the strong interaction
- the weak interaction

Physicists have unified this into the "Standard Model" which looks like this:

In 2021 Fermi lab discovered a "Dark" matter force which could be later added as a fifth forceðŸ˜±
