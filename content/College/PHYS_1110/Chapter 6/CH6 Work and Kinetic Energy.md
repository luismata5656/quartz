## Hook's Law:

$$F = k\triangle x$$

## Work:

$$W = Fx$$

## Kinetic Energy:

$$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

## Power:

$$P = \frac{W}{\triangle t} = F\frac{\triangle x}{\triangle t} = Fv$$

# Hooke's Law

this law states that the strain of a material is proportional to the applied stress within the elastic limit of that material
$$ F = k \triangle x$$

# Work

A force on an object woes work if the object is displaced, thus it calculated by multiplying the force with the displacement

## Work Done by a Constant Force

the work done by a constant force in relation to the angle of displacement is $W = Fscos\theta$
This can also be written as $W = Fs$ with both F and s being vectors and multiplying through dot product

## Positive Work

When the force has a component in the direction of the displacement, work is positive

## Negative Work

Same as positive, but the force component is opposite to the displacement

## Zero Work

When the force is perpendicular to the direction of the displacement, that force does 0 work on that object

## Total Work

The work done by $\sum F$ as it is displaced is the total work.

# Kinetic Energy

The energy of motion is called kinetic energy
$$K = \frac {1}{2}mv^2$$
Kinetic Energy is scalar, can never be negative, and is zero only when a particle is at rest, its unit is the joule.

Kinetic energy increases linearly with the mass of the object:

It also increases with **square** of the speed:

# Work Energy Theorem

The work done by the net force on a particle equals the change in the particle's kinetic energy.
$$W_{tot} = K_2 - K_1 = \triangle K $$
This eventually leads to the conservation of energy theorem
on a graph of force as a function of position, the total work is equal to the area under the curve, AKA the integral between the initial and final positions.

# Power

the rate at which work is done.
$$P_{av} = \frac{\triangle W}{\triangle t}$$
Power can also be expressed in terms of force and velocity
$$ P = F v $$
