# Potential Energy and Energy Conservation

> Potential Gravitational Energy

$$\triangle U_{grav} = mg\triangle h$$

> Potential Elastic Energy

$$\triangle U_{el} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

> Conservation of Energy

$$\triangle E = \triangle K + \triangle U = \frac{1}{2}m(\triangle v)^2 - mg\triangle h = 0$$

> Determining Force from Potential Energy

$$F(x) = -\frac{d}{dx}U(x) = -(\frac{δU}{δx}i + \frac{δU}{δy}j + \frac{δU}{δz}z)$$

# Gravitational Potential Energy

When something is within the gravitational field of the earth, there is a gravitational potential energy associated with the particle
$$U_{grav} = mgy$$
As an object descends, gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which increases velocity
The change in gravitational potential energy is related to the work done by gravity
When the object moves up, `y` increases, the work done by the gravitational force is negative, and the gravitational potential energy increases.

## The Conservation of Mechanical Energy

The total mechanical energy of a system is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy.
A quantity that always has the same value is called a conserved quantity, when only the force of gravity does work on a system, the total mechanical energy of that system is conserved.

## Work and Energy Along a Curved Path

the sam expression for gravitational potential energy can be used regardless of whether the object's path is curved or straight.
$$ W\_{grav} = mgy_1 - mgy_2$$

# Elastic Potential Energy

An object is elastic if it returns to its original shape after being deformed.
Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an elastic object, such as a spring:
$$U_{el} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
The Achilles tendon is a natural spring, when it activates it reduces the amount of work your legs have to do as you run.

The graph of elastic potential energy would ideally be parabolic, with x being the position / extension of the spring and y being the always positive, potential energy.

# Conservative vs Non-Conservative Forces

A conservative force allows conversion between kinetic and potential energy. Gravity and the spring force are conservative.

The work done between two points by any conservative force

- Can be expressed in terms of a potential energy function.
- Is reversible
- is independent of the path between the two points.
- is zero if the starting and ending points are the same.

A force that is not conservative is a dissipative force

## Conservative Forces

The work done by a conservative force such as gravity depends on only the endpoints of a path, not the specific path taken between those points.

# Conservation of Energy

Non-conservative forces do not store potential energy, but they do change the internal energy of a system.
The law of conservation of energy means that energy is never created or destroyed, only changed

# Force and Potential Energy in One Dimension

In one dimension, a conservative force can be obtained from the potential energy equation using:
$$F_x(x) = -\frac{dU(x)}{dx}$$
In regions where U(x) changes most rapidly with x, this corresponds to a large force magnitude.
A conservative force always acts to push the system toward lower potential energy.
