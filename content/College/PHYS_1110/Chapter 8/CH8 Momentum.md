## Momentum:

$$p=mv=f \triangle t$$

## Force via momentum:

$$F = \frac {dp}{dt}$$

## Conservation of momentum

$$\triangle p = mv_f - mv_i = 0$$

## Center of Mass

$$r_{cm} = \frac{\sum m_i r_i}{\sum m_i}$$

## Rocket Propulsion

$$ F = v\frac{dm}{dt}$$

# Momentum and Newton's Second Law

momentum is mass in motion, the momentum of a particle therefore is mass times velocity

# Impulse

The impulse of a force is the product of the force and the time interval during which it acts
$$J = F \triangle t$$
The area under the curve of net external force and time is equal to the impulse

# Impulse and Momentum

the Impulse-momentum theorem: the change in momentum during a time interval is equal to the impulse of the net force acting on the particle
$$J = \triangle p$$

# Conservation of Momentum

External forces, such as normal force and gravity act on object in a closed system, but the vector sum is zero
therefore, the total momentum is conserved

Momentum is a vector quantity because of the velocity component

# Elastic Collisions

Because the collision is elastic, the total kinetic energy in the system is the same throughout the whole collision

# Completely Inelastic Collisions

in an inelastic collision, the total kinetic energy after the collision is less than before

# Elastic Collisions in One Dimension

if all velocities lie along the same line, you can use the following equation to implement the conservation of kinetic energy and momentum.
$$m_g(v_{A1} + V_{A2}) = M_A(V_{A1} - V_{A2})$$
When $M_B$ is greater than $M_A$, then A reverses it velocity direction

When $M_B$ is les than $M_A$, then A slows, but maintains its direction
![[Pasted image 20231101150607.png]]
When they are both similar, then A stops, and B moves with about the same speed of A:

# Center of Mass

Suppose we have several particles with masses $m_1, m_2$ and so on.
the Center of mass of the system as a whole is:
$$r_{cm} = \frac{m_1r_1 + m_2r_2 + m_nr_n}{m_1 + m_2 + m_n}$$

# Rocket Propulsion

As a rocket burns fuel, its mass decreases,
$$ F = v\frac{dm}{dt}$$
