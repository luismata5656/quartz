## [[CH2 Motion Along a Straight Line]]

### The 4 Equations of Motion

$$ x=x_0+v_0t+\frac{1}{2}a_xt^2 $$

$$ v*x = v*{0}+a_xt $$

$$ v_x^2 = v_0^2 + 2a_x(x-x_0) $$

$$ x-x_0 = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_x)t $$

## [[CH3 Motion in 2 and 3 Dimensions]]

### Position, Velocity and Acceleration Vectors

$$ r=xi + yj+zk $$
$$ v = \frac{dr}{dt} $$
$$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} $$
$$ x = (v_0cos(\theta)t $$

## [[CH4 Newton's Laws of Motion]]

### First Law: Law of Inertia

An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move at the same velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.

### Second Law: Law of Acceleration (F = MA)

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force acting upon it, and inversely proportional to its mass. This can be expressed as F = ma, where F is the force applied, m is the object's mass, and a is the resulting acceleration.

### Third Law: Law of Action and Reaction

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if an object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal and opposite force on the first object.

## [[CH5 Application of Newton's Laws]]

### First law: $\sum F = 0$

Objects in equilibrium have a net force of 0

### Second law: $\sum F = ma$

objects in dynamic motion

### Force of Friction

#### Static Friction

$$f_s = µ_s n$$

#### Dynamic Friction

$$f_d = µ_d n$$

### Force in Circular Motion

$$F = ma_{rad} = m\frac{v^2}{R} = m(\frac{4pi^2R}{T})$$

### Hook's Law

$$F = k\triangle x$$

### Work

$$W = Fx$$

### Kinetic Energy

$$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

### Power

$$P = \frac{W}{\triangle t} = F\frac{\triangle x}{\triangle t} = Fv$$

[Chapter 7](Chapter 7/CH7.md)

### Potential Gravitational Energy

$$\triangle U_{grav} = mg\triangle h$$

### Potential Elastic Energy

$$\triangle U_{el} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

### Conservation of Energy

$$\triangle E = \triangle K + \triangle U = \frac{1}{2}m(\triangle v)^2 - mg\triangle h = 0$$

### Determining Force from Potential Energy

$$F(x) = -\frac{d}{dx}U(x) = -(\frac{δU}{δx}i + \frac{δU}{δy}j + \frac{δU}{δz}z)$$
