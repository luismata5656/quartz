# Chapter 1: Introduction to Statistics

## 1.1: Statistical and Critical Thinking

Data - collections of observations, such as measurements, genders, or survey responses.
Parameter - a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population.
Statistic - a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample.
Statistics - the science of planning studies and experiments, obtaining data, and then organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions based on the data.
Population - the complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered.
Census - the collection of data from every member of the population.
Sample - a subcollection of members selected from a population.
Voluntary Response Sample - consists of people who choose themselves by responding to a general appeal.

### The Steps of a Statistical Study

1. Prepare

Find the context of the data, what does is represent? What is the goal of the study?
Find the source, is the data from a source that might add a pressure to obtain specific results?
Analyze the sampling method, is the sample representative of the population?

2. Analyze

Graph the data, what does it look like?
Explore the data,

- Are there any outliers?
- WHat stats / numbers could summarize this data?
- How is the data distributed?
- is there any missing data?
- Are there any patterns in the data?
  Apply Statistical Methods, calculate using technology to gain results.

3. Conclude

Significance, are the results statistically or practically significant?

### Statistical and Practical Significance

Statistical Significance - achieved in a study when we get a result that is very unlikely to occur by chance.

Practical Significance - when the result is meaningful in the real world.

## 1.2: Types of Data

in order to understand the data, we need to understand the types of data we are working with.

Parameter - a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population.
Statistic - a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample.

### Categorical Data

Qualitative data consists of names or labels, a set of bool values essentially.

### Quantitative Data

Consists of numbers representing counts or measurements.

### Discrete Data

result when the number of possible values is either a finite number or a "countable" number.

### Continuous Data

Result from inifinite number of possible values that are not countable. a rolling statistic.
Indicators, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are also continuous data.

### Levels of Measurement

there are 4 levels of measurement, nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.

nominal - data that consists of names, labels, or categories only. no order can be imposed on the data.
ordinal - data that can be arranged in some order, but differences between data values either cannot be determined or are meaningless.
interval - can be ordered, and meaningful differences between data entries can be calculated. zero represents a position on a scale.
ratio - can be ordered, and meaningful differences between data entries can be calculated. zero represents a position on a scale and indicates that the quantity doesn't exist.

as you get closer to ratio, the data becomes more useful.

### 1.3: Collecting Sample Data

The method used to collect data can influence the qualilty of the analysis.

#### Sampling Techniques

##### Simple Random Sample

A sample of size n from a population of size N is obtained through SRS if every possible sample of size n has an equally likely chance of occuring.

##### Stratified Sample

Subdivide the population into at least two different subgroups that share the same characteristics, then draw a sample from each subgroup.

##### Cluster Sample

Divide the population into sections, then randomly select some of those clusters, and then choose all members from those selected clusters.

##### Systematic Sample

select some starting point and then select every kth element in the population.

##### Convenience Sample

use the results that are easy to get.
