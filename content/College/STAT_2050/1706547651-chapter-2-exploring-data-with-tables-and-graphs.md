# Chapter 2: Exploring Data with Tables and Graphs

## 2.1 Frequency Distribution

A frequency distribution is a table the shows how data is partitioned among several categories by listing the categories along with the number (frequency) of data values in each of them.

### Relative Frequency Distribution

This is a table that shows the fraction or proportion of the total number of data items belonging to the corresponding class.

### Gaps

Gaps in the data can show that the data may be from two or more populations or it has some outliers.

### Cumulative Frequency Distribution

the frequency for each class is the sum of the frequencies for that class and all previous classes.

### Normal Distribution

The frequency starts low, increases to a maximum, and then decreases to a low level again. The highest point on the curve is the mean.

## 2.2 Histograms

a graph consisting of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other.
the x axis represents quantitative data values and the y axis represents frequencies.

### Skewness

a distribution of data is skewed if it is not symmetric and extends to one side more than the other

positive skewness means the data extends to the right
negative skewness means the data extends to the left

Unifrorm distribution is when the data is evenly distributed
Normal distribution is when the data is symmetric and bell shaped

## 2.3 Graphs that Enlighten and Graphs that Deceive

### Time Series Graph

This graph shows data that changes over time

### Dot Plot

A graph of quantitative data in which each data value is represented by a dot

### Stem and Leaf Plot

![StemStats.png](StemStats.png)

Repeesents quantitative data by seperating each value in to two parts; the stem and the leaf

the stem consists of all but the final digit

the leaf consists of the final digit
