# Chapter 4: Probability

## Basic Concepts of Probability

### Theoretical Probability

$$P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$$

### Rules of Probability

Rule 1: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$

Rule 2: $P(S) = 1$
The sum of all the probabilities of the sample space is equal to 1.

Rule 3: The Complement Rule
definition: $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$

$P(A) + P(A') = 1$

> Example: If the probability of an event is 0.7, then the probability of the complement of the event is 0.3.

Rule 4: The Addition Rule
if $A$ and $B$ are _disjoint_ events, then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

#### The General Addition Rule

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
Add the probabilities of the two events and then subtract the probability of their intersection.

Rule 5: The Multiplication Rule

the **Multiplication Rule for Independent Events**:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$$

#### Dependent Events

if the occurrence of one event affects the occurrence of the other, then the events are dependent.

#### Conditional Probability

The probability of B GIVEN A:
$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$

> Example: If the probability of event A is 0.3 and the probability of event B given that event A has occurred is 0.5, then the probability of both events A and B occurring is 0.15.
