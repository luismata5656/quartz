1. A medical school claims that 28% of its students plan to go into general practice. It is found that among a random sample of 130 of the schoolâ€™s students, 32% of them plan to go into general practice. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the proportion of medical students who plan to go into general practice is actually higher than what the school claims.

   B. There is enough evidence to support the claim that 28% of medical students go into general practice.
1. A recent national survey found that high school students watched an average of 6.8 movies per month. A random sample of 36 college students revealed that the mean number of movies watched last month was 6.6 with a standard deviation of 0.5 movies. Use a significance level of 0.05 to determine if college students watch fewer movies per month on average than high school students.

   B. There is not enough evidence to support the claim the high school students watched an average of 6.8 movies per month.
3. The average miles per gallon (mpg) for a certain model of minivan is stated to be 21.0 mpg for city driving. The population standard deviation is known to be 3.75 mpg. A consumer group wants to test whether or not this minivan model actually gets 21.0 mpg on average. For the study, random sample of 49 minivans were selected that resulted in a sample mean of 19.8 mpg. Use a significance level of 0.01 to test the claim.

   B. There is enough evidence to support the claim that the average mpg is 21 mpg.
