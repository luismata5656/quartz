Cognitive Load is an ammount of stress or force that is the brain is under in order to solve a certain problem or task.

The brain only has so much CGL, and when it runs out, memory retention begins to deteriorate.

It wants to be used, and may sometimes be used on the wrong things. What you give to the brain does not matter to CGL, but only the fact that there is input happening for it to digest and compute.
