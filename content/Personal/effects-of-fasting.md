## Biological Mechanisms

There are certain mechanisms that happen in our body, these run on a clock, fasting aims to align the consumption of food with this clock

### JAMA Study

This paper looks at weight loss in people following various different weight loss over a 12 month period
It is shown that there is no significant difference between people following a healthy low-fat diet vs. people following a healthy low-carb diet.
This was massive because it seems that there should be large differences there, but in the area of weight loss, these diets didn't do anything [^1]

If one's main goal is to lose weight, the only thing that really matters is Calories In vs Calories Out and the context in which it is used

### Calories In vs Calories Out

The only real caveat here is that there is a lot more that goes into the calories out, basal metabolic rate might be different depending on fidgeting/movements throughout the day. other hormones can also greatly affect it, such as the thyroid hormone, insulin, along with testosterone and estrogen levels.

There is no perfect way to activate all the benefits, but fasting / feeding can help in a very beneficial way

### The Perfect Diet

When trying to eat correctly, there is not a one size fits all, on a macro scale and a micro scale, on any given day there is a context that has to be taken into account, so what you did the day before and other factors can greatly change what a person needs to eat.

### Conditions in the body

When we eat vs when we don't eat there are certain conditions set, some being good, some being bad
When you eat:

- Blood Sugar goes up
- Insulin goes up
- Glucose goes up

What you eat determines how much each of these factors change

## Feeding Windows

feeding windows should be placed during the active part of the day, for humans this is the morning and the evening

Eating during nocturnal hours can be detrimental effects(This is the same with light)

In the study discussed, restricting the feeding window caused positive health benefits such as lean body mass, fat loss, and many other such benefits
It also stabilized the circadian rhythm inside the genes

When mice restrict their feeding to the most active 8 hour period, many of the circadian rhythm genes locked in and synchronized.
This is also highly correlated with light, light is the most important timekeeper for these genes, and food is the second most important.

This study has also been applied to humans and the same results happened.
During the daytime is when you want to eat, it is bad to eat late at night

the liver suffers when we eat late, and the liver relates to metabolic rates.

Food intake sets certain conditions in the body, so anytime we eat there is a time afterwards that requires digesting, and eventually turning the food into energy, this costs energy.
If this process is always happening or happening in the wrong time of the day, certain genes and inflammatory markers may fire a lot more than they need to.
In ideal situations these genes are reduced when there is no food to digest, and this can be achieved with time restricted feeding

## Foundational Protocol

There are some absolutes:

- it pays off in metabolic and health sense to not ingest any food in the first hour of waking, and potentially longer
- for the 2-3 hours before bedtime, there should be no ingesting of calories, this includes liquid

### When is the ideal window?

There are some general frameworks to determine this

Since we are fasting during sleep already, there is a tie between fasting and sleep, so it is beneficial to extend the fast into the morning and start in the evening
When we sleep we undergo lots of cleaning in our body, fasting of any kind enhances these autophagic conditions.

When we eat the digestion takes about 5-6 hours, so when you stop eating, you are not in a fasted state yet.
Your eating window should be attached to the sleep cycle
So while it is good to push the fast in the morning, it has to be taken into account that we have to be in a fasted state by the time we are sleeping, because that is a "deep" fast, so pushing a fast until 1400 or later could be detrimental

so 5-6 hours before bedtime should be when the last meal should be eating, so if sleeping around 2300 the last meal should be around 1700.
The schedule he proposes ends the window at 2000, so that by the time you are in deep sleep you are fasted, so the window would start at around noon

### Muscle Mass

Very large meals take longer than small meals obviously so there is that to consider

Foods are high in fats raise the time as well

So when trying to put on muscle mass you need to consider this time to convert between states depending on the volume and content of food, so when bulking the window should almost be slightly smaller than a cut

### One Meal Per Day

having a window of about 4-6 hours do produce positive effects, however they either produce no change or increase in body weight, so it seems like they are overeating in this

One meal per day doesn't last 4-6 hours, so on this schedule people were reported to lose weight, but this is also extremely difficult and can lead to under-eating.

_The ideal window length is 7-9 hours_

### Cell Press Journal

This study looked at the distribution of protein intake in different meals delivered at different times of the day
it involved Hypertrophy training, it appears that hypertrophy happens more if their is more protein synthesis early in the day, this is due to a gene called BMAL

BMAL regulates protein synthesis pathways in muscle cells, so early protein intake leads to higher cell growth

If your main interest is to gain muscle, eating early in the day is better, generally eat all major protein before 1000.

### Offsetting feeding window drift

There are some things you can do to counteract the effects of letting a feeding window drift outside of the plan, which will happen from time to time

One of these things is decreasing the time it takes to go from a fed state to an unfed state

#### Glucose Clearing

Light movement and exercise can accelerate the digestion process
This could be a light walk or simple aerobics

##### Effects of HIIT training

if you train early, glucose levels will increase
if you train late, glucose levels will decrease

if you eat later in the day but want to sleep in an unfed state, HIIT training in the evening can help to decrease the transition and lower blood glucose levels.

##### Glucose disposal agents

Supplements can greatly decrease the digestion time really fast, one drawback to this is that you can very easily become hypoglycemic.
