# LEVELS of Thinking

level 1: Survive
Basic moment to moment needs, only personal needs, never thinking of others

Level 2: Connect
basic socialn structure, realizing that other people need things as well?
What I do affects what others do for or to me

level 3: Control
I know that other people are aware of other people, each person has an opinion, and each person acts according to what they want others to think of them

level 4: Belong
the primary drive is to fit in, the second person perspective, no longer do you think about what you are feeling but also about everyone elses feelings
"Dont't judge someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes"
This is the beginning of morality

level 5: Achieve
looking at how we observe ourselves, a good example is religion, it is questioning what is right, and why that system of thinking is right. this is a global level. This is the beginning of ethics.
How does a stranger see my culture / religion / etc.?

Level 6: Role of the Perciever
4th person perspective, what does it mean to observe a religion / culture / etc.?
because of who you are, you cannot objectively observe the world, you are a part of it. multiple valid perspectives
how do I know that the red that I see is the same red that you see?
Who are you to judge me?

Level 7: Harmonize
First level to understand and include all previous levels. now it is understood what each level needs to be happy. it looks at the fourth person perspective over time, giving an awareness of self as history of experience. eg a culmination of all developement up to this point.
We all change over time, so does this behavior / belief / etc. still work for me? and does it belong here?

Level 8: Sanctify
another step, we are now witnessing a change over time, aware of the construct, aware of how you are changing. you can see how different you see the world.
I can see that this current envireonment is changing who I am and I can see what factors are specifically changing that. I can see that I am changing.
Analyzing a person's reaction, not just reacting to it.

Level 9: Complete
All I've ever done is watch and wish. Everyone is watching something different because everyone is different and that changes over time which is then observed by level 8 and now you can see the actual driver towards change, you are simply observing yourself observing the world that is changing you. that world is also changing because of you. It is a self fulfilling prophecy.
I've held a mirror up to myself, and I am observing the mirror which is changin my perception of me which is changing me which is changing the mirror, and so on and so forth.

I think I've only enter level 9 a couple times when deep in prayer or meditation, but I can comfortably be at level 7 using the information around me, however limited that is. I can see how I am changing, and I can see how others are changing, and I can see how the world is changing. I can see how the world is changing me, and how I am changing the world.
