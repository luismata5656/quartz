# Reverse Engineering

Wikipedia defines reverse engineering as:

> Reverse engineering, also called backwards engineering or back engineering, is the process by which an artificial object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, code, or to extract knowledge from the object. It is similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is conducted into a natural phenomenon.
