# Rust

[Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)

Rust is a low level systems language

the compiler refuses code with bugs that are accepted in other languages, making the compiler more of a tool to work alongside.

Rust ecosystem:

- Cargo - like npm, manages dependencies and builds code
- rustfmt - formats code to ensure consistent styling
- Rust Language Server - powers IDE, this also encapsulates the LSP
